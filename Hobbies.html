        <b>Graphic design</b> is a profession, academic discipline and applied
        art whose activity consists in projecting visual communications intended
        to transmit specific messages to social groups, with specific
        objectives. Graphic design is an interdisciplinary branch of design and
        of the fine arts. Its practice involves creativity, innovation and
        lateral thinking using manual or digital tools, where it is usual to use
        text and graphics to communicate visually.

        Exploration is the process of exploring, an activity which has some
        expectation of discovery. Organised exploration is largely a human
        activity, but exploratory activity is common to most organisms capable
        of directed locomotion and the ability to learn, and has been described
        in, amongst others, social insects foraging behaviour, where feedback
        from returning individuals affects the activity of other members of the
        group.
