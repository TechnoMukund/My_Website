            Cascading down a series of seven tiers from a height of 300 feet,
            Manimuthar Falls is a visual masterpiece. Surrounded by lush
            greenery, the plunge pool at the base of the falls is ideal for a
            refreshing dip.

          Steeped in history and architectural grandeur, the Arulmigu
          Nellaiappar Temple is the heart and soul of Tirunelveli. Dedicated to
          Lord Shiva, worshipped here as Nellaiappar, the temple complex is a
          labyrinthine marvel. Twin towers, or gopurams, pierce the sky, adorned
          with intricate carvings depicting scenes from mythology.
